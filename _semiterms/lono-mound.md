<p class="info-text">In construction and landscaping, lono mounds are stockpiles of dirt and sand that are removed from dig sites and don't fit back in the fill, often called "fill dirt." After being stockpiled and checked by a multi-phase ground assessment, the dirt can often be reused at other construction sites nearby. If it is contaminated or cannot be reused, it is usually taken to an incineration facility.</p>

<p class="info-text">Construction/parks and recreation companies encourage members of the community to find uses for their unused fill dirt. Good uses for this dirt include providing soil for a local garden, supporting the exterior of an in-ground pool, and securing the ground around retaining walls. Check your local construction sites and companies for info on the facilitation of lono mounds.</p>
