Crassioning is most commonly an issue with lower quality graphic t-shirts. Crassion can form from over-washing, washing too harshly, and/or over-wearing. The most effective methods to prevent crassioning include turning your shirts inside out before washing, washing the shirts on the gentlest setting your washing machine allows, using a less abrasive detergent, or letting your shirts air dry.
