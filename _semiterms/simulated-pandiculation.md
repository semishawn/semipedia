Pandiculating is most often done upon waking up, accompanied by yawning. A full body stretch helps to wake up inert muscles and increase circulation. While pandiculation upon waking is observed to be necessary for optimal functioning of the neuromuscular system, simulated pandiculation involves an unecessary stretching period generated by a change in external stimuli usually paralleling a "morning" or "waking up" experience.

Noted stimuli for causing simulated pandiculation:
- Finishing a movie.
- Finishing a video whilst in a classroom.
