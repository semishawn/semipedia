<p class="info-text">Fussifrases are often used when an individual wants to contribute to a conversation but has nothing meaningful to say. They are defined by their word choice, often including adverbs such as "very," "really," "many," "pretty," and/or "so" that taint the phrase/sentence with an inherently vague and unspecific remark. Other times, they include modal auxiliaries such as "should," "would," "can," "will," and/or "might" that make the phrase/sentence vague in its sense of purpose and obligation.</p>

<p class="info-text">Fussifrases are meant to be specifically unspecific, however, this can be subjective. They are very much dependant upon the context of which they are shoehorned into. Here are a few clearcut examples of them:</p>

<p class="info-text" style="color:var(--grey10)">
	<i>"That mountain looks really big. I bet it's very far away."</i>
</p>

<p class="info-text" style="color:var(--grey10)">
	<i>"Ethan is usually pretty nice. I wonder why he's being weird."</i>
</p>

<p class="info-text" style="color:var(--grey10)">
	<i>"That price seems good. We will talk about it later."</i>
