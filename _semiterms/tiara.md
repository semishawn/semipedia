Examples of tiaras in recursive acronyms:
* *G* is the tiara of GNU (GNU's Not Unix)
* *W* is the tiara of WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator)
* *V* is the tiara of VISA (Visa International Service Association)
* *T* is the tiara of TIARA

The letter *t* was chosen because "tiara" is the only word in the English language to end in "-iara", a specification necessary for the self-recursiveness of the acronym.

A tiara is most commonly the first letter of the acronym, such as with GNU. Noted acronyms with a tiara in a different letter position include:
* [YOPY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yopy){:.inline}{:target="_blank"} &mdash; "Your own personal YOPY"
* GRUNGE &mdash; defined by Homer Simpson in The Simpsons episode "That '90s Show" as "Guitar Rock Utilizing Nihilist Grunge Energy"
