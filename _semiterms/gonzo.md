<p class="info-text">Yeah this one's dumb. But it's fun to say.</p>

<p class="info-text">There are multiple other preexisting definitions for the term gonzo. In journalism, gonzo refers to "Using an unconventional, exaggerated and highly subjective style, often when the reporter takes part in the events of the story." In modern slang, this definition has devolved to describe any person, place, thing, or idea that seems bizarre, crazy, or simply unconventional. This definition is also the root of gonzo pornography, which involves many close-up camera angles, akin to POV (or point of view) pornography. Additionally, gonzo may refer the the Muppet character Gonzo, also known as The Great Gonzo or Gonzo the Great.</p>
