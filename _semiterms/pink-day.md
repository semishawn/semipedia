A pink day can be prompted by a psychiatric requisite (such as a doctor's visit or therapy appointment), or by one's own personal desires/demands. In rare cases, a pink day may be warranted by positive emotions, such as having extreme or overwhelming joy in a way that would prevent one from being fully prepared for their job or school day.
