<p class="info-text">I am aware that the basis of agnosticism is reliant upon the belief that a god of such nature does not and will not ever exist. However, I believe Haem could act as a substitute deity for the sake of parody, amusement, and conversational ease. Haem serves to be an expressive vernacular persona, of which to be expanded upon creatively. The renditions of Haem are not only allowed to, but encouraged to vary artistically.</p>
