Long ago the birds ceased singing their chimes into my ears.
Now I desire a new music, a music I know how to listen to but not how to find.
I am saddened by its absence in my life.
My tender arms are beginning to harden, and I let them, because they saddened most of all.
In my ignorance, a fire has sprouted, but no figures of meaning have ignited it, banishing it only to my senses.
I deem it a controlled fire, and I let it burn, and burn even more, for in its ashes will grow fresh life.
I am enthralled, but I am not allowed to be. None are allowed to be excited by their own destruction.
But I am excited nonetheless, and I don’t wish I wasn’t.
When a fire burns in the woods you can see it.
And you can hear it.
And you can smell it.
But you can not feel it. Not unless you are there.
You can not bask in its warmth unless you are where the warmth wants you to be.
So I don’t shy away from it.
I feed it.
And I listen to its music.
