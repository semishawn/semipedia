Traversing through the forest was amusing until I forgot myself on the way back.
I was at first confused by what I already knew then fascinated by what I didn’t.
Though I loved to watch water drip from one leaf to another, I never wished for it to occur.
It happened so often and so importantly as my arms swayed by the sides of my waist.
Even as I sat in the tributary of youth, I found evils in myself and that which I previously loved.
What was once a calm trickle of moisture was now a frenzied downpour that I invited to drown me without objections.
As deliberate and unapologetic as the water may have been, it failed to wash away the very items I wished upon washing.
The scruff on my face and the dirt beneath my fingertips wouldn't cleanse in the liquid.
Instead, it washed away a thin layer around my mind, and I became susceptible to the distant flourish of green and trees and vines in ways I didn’t believe I ever was before.
But the longer I looked, the deeper I drowned, and the less found I remained.
Until I was no longer I, and it was no longer it.
We were we, and what thumped in my heart shook in the branches, and what breathed in my lungs swayed upon the shrubbery.
In the corners of the depths of the darkest parts of our imagination grew weeds that blackened even before they begun to perish, yet we enjoyed it with every part of our existence.
