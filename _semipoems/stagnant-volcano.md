The lava gets hotter
Yet it never erupts.
I find peace in its patience
And its aversion to appear lusty.
If only this volcano emitted its blaze.
If only it rained its ashes down upon us Pompeians
Cornered by our impending ruination.
We’d prove it useful to lose ourselves in fantasies
And thoughts of which aren’t there
While we surrender our progress to the magma
Giving up our movement to the liquid stone.
In this moment I should wish to forget my thoughts.
Have them burned like the wood that builds this city.
I don’t want my past to affect the future
Even though I know it will burn a hole
In the perfect crystal prospects people withhold
Those of which will never leave unless burned.
If only our thoughts were still
Like the mountain that’s tempered beyond secure.
