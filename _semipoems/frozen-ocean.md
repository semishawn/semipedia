Our ocean gets colder
Yet never freezes.
I hate the way our fish keep swimming
And never think to find heat.
What if this ocean reached its fate?
What if the waves stopped their flow
And motion ceased to brigade?
What if fluid no longer dictated our capability
And those shifting became shiftless?
The frost contained everyone and everything
Even those who deserved to wander
Would be kept invulnerable by the ice.
The sea surface now a wintry divider from the summer above.
I wonder if our problems would be regarded separately
As pain results from termination yet nothing has collapsed.
The distress may crack upon the chilled facade
But it will never prevail lower if the hope is unchanged.
If only our hope was frozen
Like the pacific thatâ€™s too cold for its own health.
