How are we so savvy of the moon
Without having ever lived on it
Maybe habitation isn’t needed to expound knowledge
Maybe it only inspires us to believe
To believe we know more about the moon than we actually do
The moon’s illuminating guru has no regard for its craters
Its cracks
Its darkness
Yet it keeps painting the ocean with its light
Few entities in our narrow slice can prove that
I’m envious of this beacon above
It’s too pure for our broken personas
But it’s a simple joy to gaze upon the moon
For it has so graciously allowed us to view upon its face.
