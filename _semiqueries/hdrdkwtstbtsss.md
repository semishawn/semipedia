tldr: "With a lack of closed-lip consonant sounds, \"well\" is sometimes pronounced easier with less demanding phonemes such as \"u\" or \"oo\"."

In the past, when radio DJs relied on mixing vinyl records while broadcasting, the lyrical entrance time would have been written somewhere on each disc for the DJ to stay conscious of. Nowadays, radio stations use a variety of digital software to interlay song files. Popular programs such as RCS Zetta allow the DJ to attach dynamic timing information to each audio file.

DJs listen through studio speakers which cut off via a connection to the console microphone switch when they wish to talk. The DJ then relies on their headphones to hear the music behind their voice. Most DJs will practice talking up specific songs off the air, so they get very good at memorizing when to cut off.
