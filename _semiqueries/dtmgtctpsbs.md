tldr: "With a lack of closed-lip consonant sounds, \"well\" is sometimes pronounced easier with less demanding phonemes such as \"u\" or \"oo\"."

In both modern British and American English, it is fairly common to pronounce the interjection "well" as "wool," "woll," or "wull". Certain dialects and accents can emphasize this sound more.

This is an example of the neutralization of the phonetic /ɛ/ sound that sometimes occurs when speaking quickly or with loose lips. That is to say /wɛl/ becomes /wḷ/ or even /wʊ/, most often when preceding a vowel phoneme, such as in "yeah" or "alright".
